    Remove unmatched closing parentheses at the end of the string.

    Parse an LLM response for a tool action and its input.

    This function searches the given text for lines starting with

    the tool name (action) and the argument string. For calculator
    tools (all except 'llm_knowledge'), it will clean up any excess
    parentheses and evaluate the argument as a Python literal.

              For calculator tools, this will be a Python object (e.g.,
